                    <h3>Who Is Covered</h3>

                    <h2>3. Open-Source Licensing and Ownership</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Open-Source Code:</strong> The bStats Code is provided under an open-source license,
                        which is separate from these TOS. Your use of bStats Code is governed by that open-source
                        license.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Plugins:</strong> Plugin developers retain their respective rights to their original
                        plugin code. Nothing in these TOS transfers ownership of any plugin intellectual property to
                        bStats.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Relocation of the Java Metrics class is explicitly permitted, either by manually editing
                            the “package” when using the copy-paste Metrics classes or by using relocation tools
                            when using build tools like Maven or Gradle.
                        </li>

                            could be considered personal under the GDPR or similar privacy regulations. This includes,
